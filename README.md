#Quick Events

Drop this on a website to quickly enable event tracking for google analytics on websites and web apps. Some of the tracking is built for sites using bootstrap 3 but they can be removed or modified to work with other frameworks or scripts. 

###Anchors
First checks for a title tag, if none is present it then checks for the text inside the anchor and if none is present it used the `ID` and `Class` of the anchor.

###Bootstrap Modals
Tracks modal window shown and sends the modal window title with event action `Shown` and category `Modal`.
Tracks modal window hidden and sends the modal window title with event action `Hidden` and category `Modal`.

###Bootstrap Carousel Indicators

 Tracks carousel indicator clicks and sends the action `Clicked` with category `Carousel Indicator` and label `Carousel Name`.
